          <Paragraph>
            At Canvass Analytics, we build tools that allow industrial engineers
            to train machine learning models on their process data and deploy
            them for real-time predictions. As a Fullstack Software Engineer at
            Canvass, I work to identify problems, design solutions, and
            implement functionality across the stack. Most of my work focuses on
            our front-end React app, our Kafka-based ingestion pipeline, and our
            Kubeflow-orchestrated training pipeline.

            Fourwalls Digital is a tool built for real estate agents and
            brokerages in Toronto. During my coop with Fourwalls, I participated
            in the design and implementation of an extension that allows
            administrators to manage the user accounts of real estate agents,
            and the privileges that they have within the Fourwalls Digital
            platform. I also extended the functionality and capabilities of the
            platform to allow users to host exclusive real estate listings, and
            extend existing listings with additional information, photographs,
            and videos.

            AbacusNext offers a range of digital tools for lawyers and law

            their mobile application, allowing them to avoid the expensive
            redesigns that would have been needed to synchronize them. I also
            designed and implemented a replacement for AbacusNext&apos;s

            MetricWire is a survey-delivery tool for mobile phones. At
            MetricWire I worked on the company&apos;s Android application. I
            designed and implemented survey functionality that allows the
            application to track the user&apos;s GPS location throughout the
            day, summarize their movements in an easy-to-understand format, and
            present the summary to the user for clarification and submission. I
            coordinated visual design with the iOS development team in order to
            eliminate discrepancies across the platform, any of which could
            introduce platform bias into survey results.

            at CBTS. Taking a leadership role on a team of coop students, I
            designed the specifications for the modules that manage desired
            applications, reviewed completed modules to ensure correct
            functionality and adherence to coding style guidelines, and
            organized modules into larger catalogues to represent the complete
            target configuration of a specific workstation, or class of
            workstations.
